But there is limited time and I end up listening to only some of them! I'm subscribed to several interesting podcasts that release 1-2 episodes a week and the problem is that it's hard to identify an episode that would appeal to me. While many episodes provide show notes, additional links and timestamps, I don't find them very helpful in truly understanding the unique aspects and making me want to listen to it! How can I make this discovery process more interesting and efficient?"

It would include information about the guest on the episode, the main topics discussed as well as some highlights. It would work by collecting a list of RSS feeds from the user and on a periodic basis, process the latest episodes and generate the newsletter. This acts as a round-up of the week, provides the user with the right level of detail that allows them to decide which of the episodes are appealing and must be listened to."
